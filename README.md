# SIProjectDuck

A project created for my Senior Capstone Individual project at Augustana College. 

# What is this project?
The main goal of the project was to learn how to use Unity's new Input System to allow for a multiplayer game where the players can choose what controller they'd like to use. The game is designed for 2 players and the goal is to fire projectiles at the opposing player to reduce their health to 0. The players can dodge, which makes their character immune to the projectiles, double jump in the air, 

## Instructions
You can find the game's files on the [Releases](https://github.com/alexanderfedor18/SIProjectDuck/releases/tag/v1.0) page. Currently the project only supports windows.
